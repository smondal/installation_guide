Building Our Extension
We’ll have a lot more to say about building extensions later. For now, though, all we have
to do is follow these steps:
1. Create a file called extconf.rb in the same directory as our my_test.c C source file.
The file extconf.rb should contain the following two lines:
Download samples/extruby_3.rb
require 'mkmf'
create_makefile("my_test")


2. Run extconf.rb. This will generate a Makefile:
% ruby extconf.rb
creating Makefile


3. Use make to build the extension. On an OS X system, you’d see:
% make
gcc -fno-common -g -O2 -pipe -fno-common -I.
-I/usr/lib/ruby/1.9/powerpc-darwin7.4.0
-I/usr/lib/ruby/1.9/powerpc-darwin7.4.0 -I.
-c my_test.c
cc -dynamic -bundle -undefined suppress -flat_namespace
-L'/usr/lib' -o my_test.bundle my_test.o -ldl -lobjc
The result of all this is the extension, all nicely bundled up in a shared object (a .so, a .dll,
or [on OS X] a .bundle).

4. make install
